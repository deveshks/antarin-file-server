We have 6 subsections on the main page of the file server

1. Section 1 allows you to chose and upload a file. I have set up the server timeout to 1 hour, so as long as the file to be uploaded takes less than an hour to be upload, it should safely upload

2. Section 2 allows to add users to the system (john,dave etc.) which will be user for file access privileges

3. Section 3 allows you to delete all users and files from the system, so you can start frest

4. Section 4 gives you all the files for a particular user, which you added to the system earlier.

5. Section 5 gives you all the files currently on the system

6. Section 6 gives you all the users currently in the system

If you click any link on the file, it will take you to a file view page, where you can see the name and size of the file, you can view the file, get a download link and get the users associated to the file. You can also add any existing user to the file as well.

A normal test flow might be.

1. Add a file in section 1.
2. Add a user in section 2.
3. Get file for that user in section 3. It shows empty
4. Navigate to file view and add the added user to the file and go back.
5. Get file for that user in section 3. It shows the file now.
6. Delete all in Section 3 when done
